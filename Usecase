1.Messages are classified into spam and non-spam using messages and rid field and with Sequential Neural Network
2.Non spam messages are furthur classified into updates and enquiry using data preprocessing as follows:
                a.Removing messages in rhetorical format
                b.Removing messages with irrelevent station information
3.Useful tags will be extracted from updates as follows:
                a.Station name
                b.Train name
                c.Categories:
                                        I.Stuck
                                        II.Delay
                                        III.Departed
                                        IV.Arrived
                                        V.Cancelled
                d.Is spam
                e.Delay time if applicable
4.Users can be notified about train status using the above extracted information
